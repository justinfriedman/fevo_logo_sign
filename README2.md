# fevo_logo_sign

## TL;DR
I made an RGB LED logo that can flash and change colors for Fevo in NYC. 30 LEDs, 120 jumper wires, 1 Arduino, some 3D printed parts.

## Description (when you give a mouse a cookie)
It all started when I brought in a 3D printed model of Fevo's logo. Someone said it would be cool if it could light up. For some reason I said I could do that. 
That is when I embarked on a creative journey that included iterative CAD modeling, fixing pesky 3D printers, a bit too much lead solder, a lot of wire and a few LEDs.
